            This website is our final project for the web development course. It was created by our team: 
            Chris Roland D. Santia, Henkel T. Telos, and Josua C. Solarte. Our goal was to build a clean 
            and easy to use site where gamers can find popular video games and learn more about them. 
            We worked hard to combine classic pixel art style with modern design, making sure the site 
            looks good and works well on all devices. This project helped us practice important skills 
            like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We hope you enjoy using GameZone as much as we 
            enjoyed creating it.
